# Arduino IDE Script Collection for ESP32


This repository contains a collection of Arduino IDE scripts specifically designed for ESP32 microcontrollers. These scripts enable you to easily implement various functionalities and projects using the ESP32 platform.

## Script List

1. **Control_2_LED_Blynk**: This script allows you to control two LEDs using the Blynk IoT platform. It provides a convenient way to remotely switch on/off the LEDs and monitor their status.

2. **kontrol_led_blynk**: With this script, you can control an LED using the Blynk app. It enables you to turn the LED on or off from your smartphone or any device connected to the Blynk cloud.

3. **led_berkedip**: The `led_berkedip` script provides a basic example of blinking an LED connected to the ESP32 board. It demonstrates the fundamental functionality of controlling an LED's state.

4. **libraries**: This folder contains additional libraries required for the scripts to function properly. Make sure to include these libraries in your Arduino IDE's library folder.

5. **saklar_bot_telegram**: Using this script, you can control a switch remotely through the Telegram messaging app. It allows you to turn the switch on/off using commands sent via a Telegram bot.

6. **saklar_sentuh**: The `saklar_sentuh` script demonstrates the implementation of a touch-sensitive switch using the ESP32's capacitive touch capabilities. It enables you to control a switch by simply touching the designated touchpad.

7. **saklar_web_server**: This script sets up a web server on the ESP32 board, allowing you to control a switch through a web interface. You can turn the switch on/off by accessing the web page served by the ESP32.

8. **sensor_sentuh_kapasitif**: The `sensor_sentuh_kapasitif` script showcases how to utilize the ESP32's capacitive touch feature to detect touch events. It provides an example of how to read touch sensor values and perform actions based on them.

Feel free to explore each script's individual folder for more details, wiring diagrams, and instructions on how to use them.

## Getting Started

To get started with these scripts, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Open the desired script in the Arduino IDE.
3. Install any required libraries from the `libraries` folder.
4. Configure your Arduino IDE for the ESP32 board (refer to the ESP32 documentation if needed).
5. Connect your ESP32 board to your computer via USB.
6. Upload the script to your ESP32 board using the Arduino IDE.
7. Monitor the serial output for any relevant information or debugging messages.
8. Enjoy experimenting with the script and exploring its capabilities!

Make sure to consult the individual script's folder for specific setup instructions and additional information.
